# Admin Dashboard Project
The dashboard project was an exercise where I demonstrated the use of CSS Grid to create a basic page layout. This project is part of The Odin Project's intermediate HTML/CSS course.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, [Boxicons](https://github.com/atisawd/boxicons), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

I began this project by drawing the layout by hand to get a better understanding of how I would organize each section with parent and child containers. My first goal was to use Grid to create the three main sections: header, nav, and main. Then, I used child Grid containers to break those sections down further. During this phase, I used lists to imitate the actual content in each section, later removing the lists. My next goal was to use Flexbox to style the finer details of each section. My final goal was to put the finishing touches on everything, including colors, fonts, icons, and shadows.

## Future Goals
- Add tactile feedback to project cards by changing the star and plus button to a solid color once clicked. 
- Add notification pop-ups for clicking the star and plus buttons on project cards.
- Add a counter to the bell element in the header that increments when you click on either the star or plus icons.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned that just using Grid or just using Flexbox is the wrong way to approach webpage layout. These tools are better used together to make creating webpages easier. Use Grid for layout and use Flexbox to style the elements inside the Grid.
